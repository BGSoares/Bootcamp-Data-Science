That's my friend and my friend's named Bob
Like the devil knows hell I know Bob well
Well enough to tell you 'bout his '67 smells
Well enough to tell you he's a hell-a-swell fellow
Well enough to tell you that we know each other better
Than we know our selves like freaks of a feather
We rock together I know Bob well
But I think he knows me better

He's as close to me as a friend can be
I'll be standin' by my buddy he'll be standin' by me
Just another half of the two headed freak

Because he's guided by the invisible force
He drives a kooky green Chrysler bad as anybody's Porsche
He's a working class drummer he's as strong as a horse

Rompin' and a-stompin' 'cause I'm in my prime
Born in the North and sworn to entertain ya
'Cause I'm down for the state of Pennsylvania
I try not to whine, but I must warn ya
'Bout the motherfuckin' girls from California
Alabama baby said, ""Hallelujah""
Good God, girl, I wish I knew ya

I know, I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
Well, I know, I know it's you
You say, ""Hello"" and then I say, ""I do""

Come back, baby, 'cause I'd like to say
I've been around the world, back from Bombay
Fox hole love, pie in your face
Livin' in and out of a big fat suitcase
Bonafide ride, step aside, Mike Johnson
Yes, I could, in the woods of Wisconsin
Wake up the cake, it's a lake, she's kissin' me
As they do when they do in Sicily

I know, I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
Well, I know, I know it's you
You say, ""Hello"" and then I say, ""I do""

Where you wanna go? Who you wanna be?
What you wanna do? Just come with me
Oh, I saw God and I saw the fountains
You and me, girl, sittin' in the Swiss mountains
Me, oh my, oh, me and Guy O
Freer than a bird 'cause we're rockin' Ohio
Around the world, I feel dutiful
Take a wife 'cause life is beautiful

I know, I know for sure
Ding, dang, dong, dong, ding, ding, dong, dong, ding, dang
Well, I know, I know it's you
Ding, dang, dong, dong, ding, ding, dong, dong, ding, dang

What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling don't stop continue

Realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody want to keep it like the kaiser

Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now

I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper
Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free love me say hell yes

I'm a low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now

Bob Marley poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it

Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now

Lucky me swimmin' in my ability
Dancin' down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility

My mom I love her 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feelin' good my brother gonna hug me
Drink my juice young love chug-a-lug me

There's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is never gonna wither
Come on everybody time to deliver

Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now

What I've got you've got to give it to your mama
What I've got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I've got you've got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water"

Push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Fallin' all over myself
To lick your heart and taste your health 'cause

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

A southern girl with a scarlet drawl
I wave goodbye to ma and pa 
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl and
Autumn's sweet, we call it fall 
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl and

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Scar tissue that I wish you saw

Someone full of fun
Do me 'till I'm well done
Little Bo Peep
Cumin' from my stun gun
Beware take care
Most motherfuckers
Have a cold ass stare
Aw baby please be there
Suck my kiss cut me my share

Hit me you can't hurt me suck my kiss
Kiss me please pervert me stick with this
Is she talking dirty 
Give to me sweet sacred bliss
Your mouth was made to suck my kiss

Look at me can't you see
All I really want to be
Is free from a world
That hurts me
I need relief
Do you want me girl
To be your thief
Aw baby just for you
I'd steal anything that you want me to

K-i-s-s-i-n-g
Chicka chicka dee
Do me like a banshee
Low brow is how
Swimming in the sound
Of bow wow wow
Oh baby do me now
Do me here I do allow

Should of been, could of been
Would of been dead
If I didn't get the message

And little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams it's Californication

It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East at least it's settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin, or is that war you're waging?

First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication

Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station To Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there and I don't mean on vacation

First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving?

First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication"

Step into a heaven
Where I keep it on the soul side

Has a piece of Aphrodite
Copulate to create
A state of sexual light
Kissing her virginity
My affinity
I mingle with the gods
I mingle with divinity

Glorious euphoria
Is my must
Erotic shock
Is a function of lust
Temporarily blind
Dimensions to discover
In time
Each into the other
Uncontrollable notes
From her snow white throat
Fill a space
In which two bodies float
Operatic by voice
A fanatic by choice
Aromatic is the flower
She must be moist

But from my brain is where I bleed.
Insanity it seems
Has got me by my soul to squeeze.

Well all the love from thee
With all the dying trees I scream.
The angels in my dreams (yeah)
Have turned to demons of greed that's mean.

Where I go I just don't know
I got to got to gotta take it slow.
When I find my piece of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time.

Today love smiled on me.
It took away my pain say please
All that you had to free
You gotta let it be oh yeah.

Where I go I just don't know
I got to got to gotta take it slow.
When I find my piece of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time.

Oh, so polite indeed
Well I got everything I need.
Oh make my days a breeze
And take away my self destruction.

It's bitter baby,
And it's very sweet.
I'm on a rollercoaster,
but I'm on my feet.
Take me to the river,
Let me on your shore.
I'll be coming back baby,
I'll be coming back for more.

Doo doo doo doo dingle zing a dong bone
Ba-di ba-da ba-zumba crunga cong gone bad

I could not forget
But I will not endeavor
Simple pleasures aren't as special
But I won't regret it never.

Where I go I just don't know
I got to got to gotta take it slow.
When I find my piece of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time.

Where I go I just don't know
I might end up somewhere in Mexico.
When I find my piece of mind
I'm gonna keep you for the end of time."

Rob another bank, he's a sock 'em in the eye guy
Tank head, Mr. Bonnie and Clyde guy
Look him in the eye, he's not my kinda guy
Never be confusion proof-uh
Pudding's sweet but too aloof-uh
Orange-eyed girl with a backslide dew said
Yo homie, who you talkin' to?
A backed up paddywagon mackin' on a cat's ass
One uppercut to the cold upper middle class
Born to storm on boredom's face
Add a little lust to the funky-ass Flea bass
Most in the race just lose their grace
The blackest hole in all of space
Crooked as a hooker, now suck my thumb
Anybody wanna come get some?

(If you have to ask) you'll never know
Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go
(If you have to ask) you'll never know
Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go-o-o-o

Don't ask me why I'm flyin' so high
Mr. Bubble meets Superfly in my third eye
Searchin' for a soul bride, she's my freakette
Soak it up inside, deeper than a secret
Much more than meets the eye
To the funk I fall into my new ride
My hand, my hand
Magic on the one is a medicine man
Thinkin' of a few
Taboos that I ought to kill
Dancin' on their face
Like a stage in Vaudeville
I feel so good, can't be understood
Booty of a hoodlum rockin' my red hood

(If you have to ask) you'll never know
Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go

Discard to bombard
Calling all you shooting stars
Holy cow, bow wow wow
Now I'm here, I'm nowhere now
Joan of Arc reincarnated
Maybe we could be related
So much blood to circulate
And so much space to decorate

It's right on time

Well, plain and simple pain
I want to but I can't complain
Death row, let us go
It's time to blow up for show
All the world reverberated
Coming through, we motorcaded
Start off when we operated
Turing up in solid stated

Is where I drew some blood

We will do our thing tonight alright
Take me through the future
It's time you're fine
Just another color coded crime
Incision and a suture
You told my friend
We would get it on no matter when
A supercavitation
Let's go you show
Me something no one will ever know
A love hallucination

Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
A lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride

You don't have to keep it if it's mine
(Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car)
Another place maybe another time
(Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried)

Complete repeat
Sitting in your car and on your street
Lost in California
Let's steal this wheel
Take a spin to find out how we feel
Just around the corner
Slow down for sound
Turn it up and no we can't be found
The body that we transcend
Asleep, you weep
Find out that the trick is never cheap
A melancholy girlfriend

Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
A lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride

You don't have to keep it if it's mine
(Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car)
Another place maybe another time
(Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried)

That's right you're right
We will do our thing tonight, alright
Drive the constellation
It's time you're fine
Just another color coded crime
The song is fascination

Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
The lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride

A May December might not be so smart
(Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car)
Arrivals that we wish would not depart
(Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried)

Don't be late cause you're my savior
Make it great whatever stays
Golden gate my rearranger
Hold my name inside your rays"

Who knew it's so damn drastic
Show me what it is you believe in
Slowly she sinks all her teeth in
Do you want to go fishing in New Orleans?
Do you want to get up early in the morning?
Take me to the river where we do the little storming
Hallelujah, I feel it warming

Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night 'fore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray

Send it off through Delaware just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind

Mexico, you are my neighbor
Home of the let's be braver
Give me all your sick and your tired
Races that we admire
Do you want to go dancing in Chicago?
Trinidad's got it bad for Tobago
Take me to the lake where we do the Avocado
Hallelujah, a desparado

Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night 'fore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray

Send it off through Delaware just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind

Coming down from the deserts where you
Caught a glimpse of the billionaire
Tell me I'm the right one for the ride
Paper signs out on the lawns
Gold minds and the priceless pawns
Does your canyon really open wide?

We got large and we got small
We got a swimming pool and a cannon ball
We turn red and we turn green
It's the craziest thing I've ever seen"
16,Red Hot Chili Peppers,Sick Love,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32909513/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/Sick+Love,"Say goodbye to Oz and everything you own
California dreamin' is a Pettibon
LA's screaming you're my home
Vanity is blasted but it's rarely fair
I could smell the Prozac in your pretty hair
Got a lot of friends, but is anyone there

I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home

Stick 'n move you're living in a quick world
Got a heavy laugh for such a tiny girl
Born into it that's for sure

Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected, well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliché

People talk and tell you what you want to hear
Do you really need another souvenir
Super heroes tend to disappear
Fame is just a trick you see an empty glass
Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
Chase your tail my baby it'll be your last

I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home

Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected, well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliché

Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected, well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliché

Openly defective is the lover you elected and
A portrait she was bound to portray"

He was feeling incomplete about to take his final fall
Last thing I remember there were tears of blood and just not mine
Any other day and I would save you from this cold decline

Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah
The next dimension, show me in

We were moving in the world, expanding your realities
A force of nature on the verge, commanding abnormalities
Last thing I remember there was ringing in my selfish ears
Twenty-six a number much too small for someone's golden years

Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah
The next dimension, show me in

You get a little bit more this time when
You give a little bit for your brother's kind
Like she always said, oh, don't look back, just look ahead

You sing a little bit stronger when you
Remember the song of your old best friend
Like she always said, oh, don't look back, just look ahead

Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young

I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah"

I still like to think that I'm new
Time just gets its way
Strawberries left to decay

Can't find my pants or my bank account
Don't you slip away
Voices that start to betray

Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my old man in the sea

I still like to laugh when I make a joke
I still like to think that there's hope
Time just has its say
Strawberries left to decay

Struck by the sight of an empty hall
Don't you fade away
Voices that start to betray

Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my old man in the sea

The hunter gets hunted
We all get confronted
Don't just slip away
Voices that start to betray

Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my old man in the sea"

What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling don't stop continue

Realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody want to keep it like the kaiser

Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now

I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper
Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free love me say hell yes

I'm a low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now

Bob Marley poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it

Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now

Lucky me swimmin' in my ability
Dancin' down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility

My mom I love her 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feelin' good my brother gonna hug me
Drink my juice young love chug-a-lug me

There's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is never gonna wither
Come on everybody time to deliver

Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now

So rare to dare

Take me home
I need repair
Take me please
To anywhere

Descend
All the way

Descended from
Demented men
Struggle with
The art of zen
Please don't look
Too close at me
You might not like
What you see

Descend

Everyday, warped and scared
Of being there

Craving
Sends me crawling oh
Beg for mercy
Does it show
A vacancy
That's full of holes
Hold me please
I'm feeling cold

And find out what it's all about
And that ain't hard
Just me and my own two feet
In the heat I've got myself to meet

A detective of perspective
I need to try and get a bigger eye, open wide
Blood wood flowers in my gaze
Walkabout in a sunny daze
To me now
On a walkabout

You could do it in the city
You could do it in a zone
You could do it in the desert
You could do the unknown
On a walkabout

High desert skies, are what I spy
So fly, you've got to wonder why
The stingrays must be fat this year
Moving slow in my lowest gear

The digeridoo original, man with a dream
I believe the Aborigine
On a walkabout

You could do it with a shuffle
You could do it with a stroll
You could do it with a stride
You could do the unknown
On a walkabout

A walk could cure almost all my blues
Bare feet or in my two shoes
One, two

I think I'll go on a walkabout
Find out what it's all about, can't hurt to try
Use your legs to rock it wide
Take a ride to the other side"

Someone spilled blood but do you know

Come your long tall daddies of a rock and roll

Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now

Spinning' down from the clouds Like a tornado
Spinnin' out of control like a psychedelic soul
With a rhythm hittin' harder than Larry Holmes
Come your long tall daddies of rock and roll

Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now (yeah)

Oh well Mr. Uplift Mofo my man Bo Diddley hit sippin' a bottle of nickle ripple
Play the lickity split finger licking licks for all you wicked city slick chicks

And all you nitty gritty hick we'll make your nipples ripple
Make you wanna dip your dipple make you wanna soak your hickory stick, that's rigth 
Because my man has a grip on it and I do mean on it
Which brings to mind a very sinister minister kind of guy
A man named Little Richard who was born to make them bitches stir
That's right he'll make the sweet substance drip from the middle of your hillbilly lips
And like the farmer milk his cow the howling wolf will howl
And since times does allow, you all can take me to your backwoods now, yo slim

Has a piece of Aphrodite

A state of sexual light
Kissing her virginity
My affinity
I mingle with the gods
I mingle with divinity

Glorious euphoria
Is my must
Erotic shock
Is a function of lust
Temporarily blind
Dimensions to discover
In time
Each into the other
Uncontrollable notes
From her snow white throat
Fill a space
In which two bodies float
Operatic by voice
A fanatic by choice
Aromatic is the flower
She must be moist

Combust
Confucius might have been confused
And Buddha might have blown a fuse
I ooze the muse

Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Frewak the cheek on your hot spot

Back and forth my body's jerking
Will to thrill will not stop working
Work and work
I'll take you on a honeymoon
Jumping on a bed in a hotel room
The room the groom

Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance
Like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Frewak the cheek on your hot spot"

I can't find the love I want
Someone better slap me
Before I start to rust
Before I start to decompose
Looking in my rear view mirror
I can make it disappear
I can make it disappear ""have no fear""

I'm turning into dust again
My melancholy baby
The star of mazzy must
Push her voice inside of me
I'm overcoming gravity
I'm overcoming gravity
It's easy when you're sad to be
It's easy when you're sad ""said 'bout me""

And music is my aeroplane

Could make me float
Could make me float away
One note from
The song she wrote
Could f*ck me where I lay
Just one note
Could make me choke
One note that's
Not a lie
Just one note
Could cut my throat
One could make me die

Well enough to tell you 'bout his '67 smells
Well enough to tell you he's a hell-a-swell fellow
Well enough to tell you that we know each other better

Free spirits but already tormented by our own hands
Given to us by our parents we got together
And wrote on desks and slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains 
And slipped through whatever cracks we can find minds altered 
We didn't falter in portraying hysterical and tragic characters
In a smog filled universe
We loved the dirty city 
And the journeys away from it 
We had not yet been or seen our friends, selves
Chase tails round and round in downward spiral 
Leaving trail of irretrievable vital life juice behind
Still the brothers blood comrades partner family cuzz was impenetrable
And we lived inside it laughing with no clothes
And everything experimental 'till death was upon us 
In our face mortality and lots of things seemed futile then 
But love and music can save us and did
While the giant grey monster grew more poisoned and volatile around us 
Jaws clamping down and spewing ugly shit around 
Nothing is the same so we keep moving
We keep moving

Went off and got some hair cuts
Lookin' wild and got all drugged up
Hopped a train into the night
Got a ride with a transvestite
Two boys in San Francisco
Two boys in San Francisco
Blasted off in a bart bathroom
Those coppers woke us up
Motherfuckers woke us up

Two young brothers on a hover craft
Telepathics love and belly laughs

Storm the stage of universal
Slim shine talk box go subversal
Papa's proud and so he sent us
Pounding hearts full and relentless
Two boys in London, England
Two boys in London, England
Climbing out of hostel windows
Wearing gear so out but in though
Come on kid and do the no no

Two young brothers on a hover craft, yeah
Telepathics, love and belly laughs, oh yeah
Oh shit
Oh shit

We went to Fairfax High School
Jumped off buildings into their pools
We'd sit down and grease at canters
Run like hell they can't catch us
Two boys in L.A. proper
Two boys in L.A. proper
Stealin' anything that we could
Gotta sneak into the starwood
Gotta peak into the deep good

I remember ten years ago
In Hollywood we did some good
And we did some real bad stuff
But the butthole surfers said 
It's better to regret something you did than something you didn't do
Yeah, we were young 
Were looking, looking, looking for the deep kick
Yeah, seen 'em come, 'em go seen, gettin' close to you"

We will do our thing tonight alright
Take me through the future
It's time you're fine
Just another color coded crime
Incision and a suture
You told my friend
We would get it on no matter when
A supercavitation
Let's go you show
Me something no one will ever know
A love hallucination

Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
A lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride

You don't have to keep it if it's mine
(Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car)
Another place maybe another time
(Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried)

Complete repeat
Sitting in your car and on your street
Lost in California
Let's steal this wheel
Take a spin to find out how we feel
Just around the corner
Slow down for sound
Turn it up and no we can't be found
The body that we transcend
Asleep, you weep
Find out that the trick is never cheap
A melancholy girlfriend

Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
A lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride

You don't have to keep it if it's mine
(Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car)
Another place maybe another time
(Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried)

That's right you're right
We will do our thing tonight, alright
Drive the constellation
It's time you're fine
Just another color coded crime
The song is fascination

Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
The lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride

A May December might not be so smart
(Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car)
Arrivals that we wish would not depart
(Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried)

Don't be late cause you're my savior
Make it great whatever stays
Golden gate my rearranger
Hold my name inside your rays"

We got many moons that are deep at play
So I keep an eye on the shadow's smile
To see what it has to say
You and I both know
Everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?
Spinning knot that is on my heart
It's like a bit of light and a touch of dark
You got sneak attacked from the zodiac
But I see your fire spark
Eat the breeze and go
Blow by blow and go away
Oh, what do you say?

Yeah, you don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design and
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Stumble down to the parking lot
You got no time for the afterthought
They're like ice cream for an astronaut
Well that's me looking for we
Turn the corner and
Find the world at your command
Playing the hand

Yeah, you don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Do you want this love of mine?
The darkness helps all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Do you want it all the time?
The darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?

Pick you up like a paperback
With the track record of a maniac
So I move it in and we unpack
It's the same as yesterday
Any way we roll
Everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?

Yeah, you don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

We got a swimming pool and a cannon ball
We turn red and we turn green
It's the craziest thing I've ever seen

Lost my mind 'cause I'm on the plastic
Who knew it's so damn drastic
Show me what it is you believe in
Slowly she sinks all her teeth in
Do you want to go fishing in New Orleans?
Do you want to get up early in the morning?
Take me to the river where we do the little storming
Hallelujah, I feel it warming

Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night 'fore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray

Send it off through Delaware just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind

Mexico, you are my neighbor
Home of the let's be braver
Give me all your sick and your tired
Races that we admire
Do you want to go dancing in Chicago?
Trinidad's got it bad for Tobago
Take me to the lake where we do the Avocado
Hallelujah, a desparado

Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night 'fore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray

Send it off through Delaware just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind

Coming down from the deserts where you
Caught a glimpse of the billionaire
Tell me I'm the right one for the ride
Paper signs out on the lawns
Gold minds and the priceless pawns
Does your canyon really open wide?

We got large and we got small
We got a swimming pool and a cannon ball
We turn red and we turn green
It's the craziest thing I've ever seen"

California dreamin' is a Pettibon
LA's screaming you're my home
Vanity is blasted but it's rarely fair
I could smell the Prozac in your pretty hair
Got a lot of friends, but is anyone there

I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home

Stick 'n move you're living in a quick world
Got a heavy laugh for such a tiny girl
Born into it that's for sure

Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected, well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliché

People talk and tell you what you want to hear
Do you really need another souvenir
Super heroes tend to disappear
Fame is just a trick you see an empty glass
Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
Chase your tail my baby it'll be your last

I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home

Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected, well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliché

Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected, well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliché

Openly defective is the lover you elected and
A portrait she was bound to portray"

He was feeling incomplete about to take his final fall
Last thing I remember there were tears of blood and just not mine
Any other day and I would save you from this cold decline

Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah
The next dimension, show me in

We were moving in the world, expanding your realities
A force of nature on the verge, commanding abnormalities
Last thing I remember there was ringing in my selfish ears
Twenty-six a number much too small for someone's golden years

Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah
The next dimension, show me in

You get a little bit more this time when
You give a little bit for your brother's kind
Like she always said, oh, don't look back, just look ahead

You sing a little bit stronger when you
Remember the song of your old best friend
Like she always said, oh, don't look back, just look ahead

Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young

I still like to think that I'm new
Time just gets its way
Strawberries left to decay

Can't find my pants or my bank account
Don't you slip away
Voices that start to betray

Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my old man in the sea

I still like to laugh when I make a joke
I still like to think that there's hope
Time just has its say
Strawberries left to decay

Struck by the sight of an empty hall
Don't you fade away
Voices that start to betray

Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my old man in the sea

The hunter gets hunted
We all get confronted
Don't just slip away
Voices that start to betray

Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my old man in the sea"

What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling don't stop continue

Realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody want to keep it like the kaiser

Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now

I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper
Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free love me say hell yes

I'm a low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now

Bob Marley poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it

Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now

Lucky me swimmin' in my ability
Dancin' down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility

My mom I love her 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feelin' good my brother gonna hug me
Drink my juice young love chug-a-lug me

There's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is never gonna wither
Come on everybody time to deliver

Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now

What I've got you've got to give it to your mama
What I've got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I've got you've got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water"

And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Pleasure spiked with pain
That mother fucker always spiked with pain

Looking in my own eyes ""hello""
I can't find the love I want
Someone better slap me
Before I start to rust
Before I start to decompose
Looking in my rear view mirror
I can make it disappear
I can make it disappear ""have no fear""

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Pleasure spiked with pain
That mother fucker always spiked with pain

Sitting in my kitchen hey girl
I'm turning into dust again
My melancholy baby
The star of mazzy must
Push her voice inside of me
I'm overcoming gravity
I'm overcoming gravity
It's easy when you're sad to be
It's easy when you're sad ""said 'bout me""

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Pleasure spiked with pain

Just one note
Could make me float
Could make me float away
One note from
The song she wrote
Could f*ck me where I lay
Just one note
Could make me choke
One note that's
Not a lie
Just one note
Could cut my throat
One could make me die

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane

Is offending me

I'm pretending see
To be strong and free
From my dependency
It's warping me

So much love
So rare to dare
Afraid of
Ever being there
Take me home
I need repair
Take me please
To anywhere

Descend
All the way

Descended from
Demented men
Struggle with
The art of zen
Please don't look
Too close at me
You might not like
What you see

Descend
All the way

Everyday, warped and scared
Of being there

Craving
Sends me crawling oh
Beg for mercy
Does it show
A vacancy
That's full of holes
Hold me please
I'm feeling cold

Descend
All the way

Everyday, warped and scared
Of being there"

And find out what it's all about
And that ain't hard
Just me and my own two feet
In the heat I've got myself to meet

A detective of perspective
I need to try and get a bigger eye, open wide
Blood wood flowers in my gaze
Walkabout in a sunny daze
To me now
On a walkabout

You could do it in the city
You could do it in a zone
You could do it in the desert
You could do the unknown
On a walkabout

High desert skies, are what I spy
So fly, you've got to wonder why
The stingrays must be fat this year
Moving slow in my lowest gear

The digeridoo original, man with a dream
I believe the Aborigine
On a walkabout

You could do it with a shuffle
You could do it with a stroll
You could do it with a stride
You could do the unknown
On a walkabout

A walk could cure almost all my blues
Bare feet or in my two shoes
One, two

I think I'll go on a walkabout
Find out what it's all about, can't hurt to try
Use your legs to rock it wide
Take a ride to the other side"

Of your loneliness
Confide, 'cause I'll be on your side
You know I will, you know I will

Ex girlfriend called me up
Alone and desperate
On the prison phone
They want, to give her seven years
For being sad

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

My friends are so distressed
And standing on
The brink of emptiness
No words, I know of to express
This emptiness

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

Imagine me taught by tragedy
Release is peace
I heard a little girl
And what she said
Was something beautiful
To give, your love
No matter what
Yeah, what she said

I love all of you

So hard and lonely too

Something or someone to come

Come along illuminate my lust
Combust
Confucius might have been confused
And Buddha might have blown a fuse
I ooze the muse

Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Frewak the cheek on your hot spot

Back and forth my body's jerking
Will to thrill will not stop working
Work and work
I'll take you on a honeymoon
Jumping on a bed in a hotel room
The room the groom

Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance
Like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Frewak the cheek on your hot spot"

Sending me oh over the moon

Friends near death, you gave respect
Sympathetic intellect
Choices are, for one and all
All we are is, leaves that fall (that's all)

Always be loving you
Now I'm away from you
Always be loving you

Round and round inside your head
Smartest fucker I ever met
Vicious fish bit at your toes
Made you lie and numb your soul

Transcending flesh could be a breeze
Sending me over the moon

Mule donkey ass you bore the load
Of all creations tortured souls
Choices are, for one and all
All we are is, leaves that fall

Water flowing and I will drink it
I will drink for you
A part of me left that only you knew
Will never be understood, will never be understood

Hey, gone to stay
Entire lifetime flash before me
In a loving stream
Hey mother may I have lost a child
But she gave birth
To a loving stream

Oh, never know
When the gods will come and take you
To a loving stream

Oh, heart of gold
The most special things you gave me were
From your loving stream

In a loving stream

F*ck the green machine
See the human being
In a loving stream

F*ck the legal greed

Breaking hearts instead of bread

Checkmated by frustration now
Need to be cut loose
A different kind of being lost a sullen cost
